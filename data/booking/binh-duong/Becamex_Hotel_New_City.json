                "comment_negative": "I stayed in one of the apartment rooms. While it was sizeable and reasonably well equipped, it did miss an iron and ironing table, which were definitely hard to get hold of in the hotel. Also, the maintenance of the hallways needed a bit of work, with spot-painting having resulted in a mosaic of paint in the corridors. Biggest issues for me were the comfort of the bed, which was pretty stiff, the ability to block out light in the bedroom, the curtains didn't quite reach the edges, and the fact that there really isn't much around the hotel within walking distance other than the conference centre. It's a great hotel when you are attending a function or a conference, but I would take a hotel in the centre of Ho Chi Minh City every time for the convenience of being able to walk around and do stuff."

While it was sizeable and reasonably well equipped, it did miss an iron and ironing table, which were definitely hard to get hold of in the hotel. Also, the maintenance of the hallways needed a bit of work, with spot-painting having resulted in a mosaic of paint in the corridors. Biggest issues for me were the comfort of the bed, which was pretty stiff, the ability to block out light in the bedroom, the curtains didn't quite reach the edges, and the fact that there really isn't much around the hotel within walking distance other than the conference centre. It's a great hotel when you are attending a function or a conference, but I would take a hotel in the centre of Ho Chi Minh City every time for the convenience of being able to walk around and do stuff."

We were there for a tennis tournament and the club was a 10min walk. Across the road there is a nice choice of restaurants and a food court.  Highly recommend the Italian pizza and pasta restaurant. The area is very quiet, not a lot happening. Hardly any traffic on the roads!!",

While it was sizeable and reasonably well equipped, it did miss an iron and ironing table, which were definitely hard to get hold of in the hotel. Also, the maintenance of the hallways needed a bit of work, with spot-painting having resulted in a mosaic of paint in the corridors. Biggest issues for me were the comfort of the bed, which was pretty stiff, the ability to block out light in the bedroom, the curtains didn't quite reach the edges, and the fact that there really isn't much around the hotel within walking distance other than the conference centre. It's a great hotel when you are attending a function or a conference, but I would take a hotel in the centre of Ho Chi Minh City every time for the convenience of being able to walk around and do stuff."
