The room is clean, simple, nicely decorated, and more spacious than similar hotels in the old town. The hotel is still new, so the furnishings are new and comfortable.\nThe bathroom was also clean, but I had a problem with hot water on the first day. However, when I called the receptionist, a very nice person named Liam was quick to help me. It was already around 10 pm, but he called an engineer and fixed it for me. Since the hotel was full that day, I could not move to another room and had to wait for the repairs to be completed, which did not take long. The showers in the other rooms didn't seem to have any problems, it just happened to be the shower in the room I stayed in. Liam said he was sorry and offered various compensation. He also arranged a cab to the airport on my return at a lower price than the market rate. \nBreakfast was delicious with different choices. Their Vietnamese noodle was very good.\nI have stayed at many different small hotels in the old town of Hanoi, and this hotel is my best. I'll stay at this hotel again when I come back to Hanoi next time.",

Any questions or issues you can easily contact via WhatsApp. They also provide information about things to see and do, they also can help you book tours. Delicious breakfast with lots of options and hot food such as soup and eggs can be ordered. Was only going to stay one night but enjoyed it so much I have extended to 3 nights.",

The hotel is still new, so the furnishings are new and comfortable.\nThe bathroom was also clean, but I had a problem with hot water on the first day. However, when I called the receptionist, a very nice person named Liam was quick to help me. It was already around 10 pm, but he called an engineer and fixed it for me. Since the hotel was full that day, I could not move to another room and had to wait for the repairs to be completed, which did not take long. The showers in the other rooms didn't seem to have any problems, it just happened to be the shower in the room I stayed in. Liam said he was sorry and offered various compensation. He also arranged a cab to the airport on my return at a lower price than the market rate. \nBreakfast was delicious with different choices. Their Vietnamese noodle was very good.\nI have stayed at many different small hotels in the old town of Hanoi, and this hotel is my best. I'll stay at this hotel again when I come back to Hanoi next time.",
