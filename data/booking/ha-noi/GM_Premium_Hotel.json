It was really welcoming - like coming home to family, from an outing. Location was great. We walked everywhere. They held our luggage while we went to Ha Long Bay for 2 nights. Lobby was beautiful. Breakfast was great, ordered eggs & pancakes. Also, loved the Vietnamese iced coffees!",

Sky brunch bar did a fabulous lunch when you want to be away from the hustle & bustle.\nMiss Vivian & all the staff are what make the warm character & feel of this place, they go above & beyond which I feel is their point of difference.\nMy children felt very welcome & did not want to leave. Thank you all for making our Hanoi experience exceptional.",
