The building is in a quite alley and therefore it’s perfect for a good sleep. There are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops around and one big supermarket in 3 min walk.

At Galaxy Home Doi Can our sleep was just great. Blackout Curtains makes the room very dark and the only noise that we could hear was a rooster, but ear plugs helped with that. No street noises or construction around this hotel during our stay in February 2024.  Room is very well designed and modern. Comes with smart tv, fridge, microwave, heating and ac also available. Having a washing machine in the room is always a bonus while travelling. Everything was perfectly cleaned and communication was friendly and professional. Easy to say if we are ever in Hanoi again we are not going to look for another hotel.",

She is always very responsive and even very patient with my basic/poor Vietnamese (that being said, she communicates very well in English). The guard/cleaning lady is also very kind and helpful! We really feel at home. \n\nIn terms of facilities, you basically get everything prepared even some essential kitchen utensils. However, since the location of this apartment is really good and close to many local restaurants, we did not use the kitchen. It is located at the end of a small 'ngõ'/alley. Even though it is only around 30 meters away from the main road, you can't hear any noise. Loads of cafes and restaurants are nearby. We actually walked to the old town quite often -- it is about 25-30 mins walk -- with quite a lots of traffic along the way, which is quite normal in Hanoi given the number of its motorbike. Otherwise, the old town is very accessible through Grab from the apartment. Usually it just takes about 10-15 mins by car. The view from the balcony is also amazing. Overall, we will definitely come back here whenever we travel to Hanoi!\n\nCảm ơn chị vì sự thân thiện và sự tốt bụng !",

We really feel at home. \n\nIn terms of facilities, you basically get everything prepared even some essential kitchen utensils. However, since the location of this apartment is really good and close to many local restaurants, we did not use the kitchen. It is located at the end of a small 'ngõ'/alley. Even though it is only around 30 meters away from the main road, you can't hear any noise. Loads of cafes and restaurants are nearby. We actually walked to the old town quite often -- it is about 25-30 mins walk -- with quite a lots of traffic along the way, which is quite normal in Hanoi given the number of its motorbike. Otherwise, the old town is very accessible through Grab from the apartment. Usually it just takes about 10-15 mins by car. The view from the balcony is also amazing. Overall, we will definitely come back here whenever we travel to Hanoi!\n\nCảm ơn chị vì sự thân thiện và sự tốt bụng !",

Perfect for long stay because it’s just 10 min away from the old city so it’s easy to get a grab there but it’s not that chaotic and noisy. The building is in a quite alley and therefore it’s perfect for a good sleep. There are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops around and one big supermarket in 3 min walk. Hot water and good pressure in shower are just a cherry on top. Overall, we had a great experience there, the manager and cleaning lady both were very nice and attentive, so highly recommend.",

Perfect for long stay because it’s just 10 min away from the old city so it’s easy to get a grab there but it’s not that chaotic and noisy. The building is in a quite alley and therefore it’s perfect for a good sleep. There are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops around and one big supermarket in 3 min walk. Hot water and good pressure in shower are just a cherry on top. Overall, we had a great experience there, the manager and cleaning lady both were very nice and attentive, so highly recommend.",

At Galaxy Home Doi Can our sleep was just great. Blackout Curtains makes the room very dark and the only noise that we could hear was a rooster, but ear plugs helped with that. No street noises or construction around this hotel during our stay in February 2024.  Room is very well designed and modern. Comes with smart tv, fridge, microwave, heating and ac also available. Having a washing machine in the room is always a bonus while travelling. Everything was perfectly cleaned and communication was friendly and professional. Easy to say if we are ever in Hanoi again we are not going to look for another hotel.",

We really feel at home. \n\nIn terms of facilities, you basically get everything prepared even some essential kitchen utensils. However, since the location of this apartment is really good and close to many local restaurants, we did not use the kitchen. It is located at the end of a small 'ngõ'/alley. Even though it is only around 30 meters away from the main road, you can't hear any noise. Loads of cafes and restaurants are nearby. We actually walked to the old town quite often -- it is about 25-30 mins walk -- with quite a lots of traffic along the way, which is quite normal in Hanoi given the number of its motorbike. Otherwise, the old town is very accessible through Grab from the apartment. Usually it just takes about 10-15 mins by car. The view from the balcony is also amazing.
