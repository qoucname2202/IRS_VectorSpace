The café is available for meals, and the friendly staff delivers breakfast and coffee to the studio upon request.  Access to the studio is through the café, which was fun.

The café is available for meals, and the friendly staff delivers breakfast and coffee to the studio upon request.  Access to the studio is through the café, which was fun.

The studio is clean, well appointed and very comfortable, including a deck and a washing machine.  It is in a building above a lovely café which is run by the owner of the studio.  The café is available for meals, and the friendly staff delivers breakfast and coffee to the studio upon request.  Access to the studio is through the café, which was fun.  The studio also has access to a great rooftop deck.  The owner was vey helpful, communicative and always friendly.   This is truly a gem.",
