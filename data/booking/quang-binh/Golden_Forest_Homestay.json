The host was absolutely fantastic! She was so kind and very welcoming. She booked a tour of the caves for us and our bus to Hanoi both at very short notice. Our bus didn’t leave Phong Nha until late at night, but the host gave us the use of the room during the day to leave our bags and shower even after we had checked out which was amazing. We would not hesitate to stay here again.",

It is located centrally and is within walking distance of restaurants and attractions. The bedroom and bathroom were modern and very very clean. The bed was cozy, the WiFi was strong, the air conditioner was very cooling, and the decor/lights were very relaxing. The staff were sweet, friendly, and accommodating. My overnight bus from Ninh Binh arrived at 3am and I was able to contact the staff at that hour and be immediately checked in! My bus back to Hanoi left at 9pm and I was also able to check out that late. I had tons of privacy (unlike in a hostel) which was ideal for me. I would stay here again in a heart beat and recommend it to everyone.",

The host was absolutely fantastic! She was so kind and very welcoming. She booked a tour of the caves for us and our bus to Hanoi both at very short notice. Our bus didn’t leave Phong Nha until late at night, but the host gave us the use of the room during the day to leave our bags and shower even after we had checked out which was amazing. We would not hesitate to stay here again.",

It is located centrally and is within walking distance of restaurants and attractions. The bedroom and bathroom were modern and very very clean. The bed was cozy, the WiFi was strong, the air conditioner was very cooling, and the decor/lights were very relaxing. The staff were sweet, friendly, and accommodating. My overnight bus from Ninh Binh arrived at 3am and I was able to contact the staff at that hour and be immediately checked in! My bus back to Hanoi left at 9pm and I was also able to check out that late. I had tons of privacy (unlike in a hostel) which was ideal for me. I would stay here again in a heart beat and recommend it to everyone.",

She helped us with everything and was always smiling! The best host I’ve had without a doubt. She will fix anything for you. The breakfast was homemade and really good, we even got breakfast after the breakfast hour without asking, and when we took the bus early in the morning she had Made us chicken baguettes.
