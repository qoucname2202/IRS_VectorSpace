The 'Urban Area' looks like a ghost town as it is still under construction. The streets and roads surrounding The block which The hotel is on, are literally being built as of today. The hotel is the only finished building in the area.\n\nThe facilities are inadequate, there is no hot water and as I am typing this, there has been a power cut. \n\nThe roads around the hotel are not even finished. The tarmac is literally wet, and has been walked in to the hotel floor including our room. Our room now smells of tarmac.  It's truly upsetting especially when we have paid to stay at a \"luxury hotel\". \n\nHas anyone from booking.com actually been here to confirm the advertised images and property description? \n\nI really hate to leave a negative review, but I feel it is necessary to warn other potential guests of what to expect, so as not to have the same experience as us. \n\nWe were advised by a member of staff that the model of the area in the hotel lobby resembles what the area will look like when it is completed in 5 years. I'm sure when the are is completed it will be wonderful, but currently, it's under construction. \n\nVery disappointed especially as booking.com is a trusted service I use regularly and would have expected a much truer picture to be painted."

The welcome tea and water each time we sat in the lobby were much appreciated to elevate the experience.

There's a lot of development around so be forewarned of construction work throughout the day.  For an elegantly designed hotel, they're still lacking some of the essentials like a functioning credit card machine.  We were asked to pay cash and more or less badgered throughout our stay on whether we would be able to make the payment - couldn't even enjoy our breakfast without being asked if we can pay the cash as we awaited to see if they can \"fix\" their credit card machine."
