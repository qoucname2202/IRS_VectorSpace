The pool was great for resting (from all the hotels with pools im Vietnam, is the only one we actually tried, as the atmosphere around it was welcoming).\n\nThe host helped with a lot of information, an did our stay even better.\n\nThe Location was also close to the best restaurants in town and close to the bus station. Not so close to Oxalis but Oxalis provides pick up and drop off from the town in any way, so was not an issue at all.\n\nOverall for the price (one of the lowest) we stayed in much better hotel than we expected, as we had just a night there. Could easily stay a week without thinking twice!",

The pool was great for resting (from all the hotels with pools im Vietnam, is the only one we actually tried, as the atmosphere around it was welcoming).\n\nThe host helped with a lot of information, an did our stay even better.\n\nThe Location was also close to the best restaurants in town and close to the bus station. Not so close to Oxalis but Oxalis provides pick up and drop off from the town in any way, so was not an issue at all.\n\nOverall for the price (one of the lowest) we stayed in much better hotel than we expected, as we had just a night there. Could easily stay a week without thinking twice!",

The pool was great for resting (from all the hotels with pools im Vietnam, is the only one we actually tried, as the atmosphere around it was welcoming).\n\nThe host helped with a lot of information, an did our stay even better.\n\nThe Location was also close to the best restaurants in town and close to the bus station. Not so close to Oxalis but Oxalis provides pick up and drop off from the town in any way, so was not an issue at all.\n\nOverall for the price (one of the lowest) we stayed in much better hotel than we expected, as we had just a night there. Could easily stay a week without thinking twice!",

The pool was great for resting (from all the hotels with pools im Vietnam, is the only one we actually tried, as the atmosphere around it was welcoming).\n\nThe host helped with a lot of information, an did our stay even better.\n\nThe Location was also close to the best restaurants in town and close to the bus station. Not so close to Oxalis but Oxalis provides pick up and drop off from the town in any way, so was not an issue at all.\n\nOverall for the price (one of the lowest) we stayed in much better hotel than we expected, as we had just a night there. Could easily stay a week without thinking twice!",

The pool was great for resting (from all the hotels with pools im Vietnam, is the only one we actually tried, as the atmosphere around it was welcoming).\n\nThe host helped with a lot of information, an did our stay even better.\n\nThe Location was also close to the best restaurants in town and close to the bus station. Not so close to Oxalis but Oxalis provides pick up and drop off from the town in any way, so was not an issue at all.\n\nOverall for the price (one of the lowest) we stayed in much better hotel than we expected, as we had just a night there. Could easily stay a week without thinking twice!",

The pool was great for resting (from all the hotels with pools im Vietnam, is the only one we actually tried, as the atmosphere around it was welcoming).\n\nThe host helped with a lot of information, an did our stay even better.\n\nThe Location was also close to the best restaurants in town and close to the bus station. Not so close to Oxalis but Oxalis provides pick up and drop off from the town in any way, so was not an issue at all.\n\nOverall for the price (one of the lowest) we stayed in much better hotel than we expected, as we had just a night there. Could easily stay a week without thinking twice!",

The pool was great for resting (from all the hotels with pools im Vietnam, is the only one we actually tried, as the atmosphere around it was welcoming).\n\nThe host helped with a lot of information, an did our stay even better.\n\nThe Location was also close to the best restaurants in town and close to the bus station. Not so close to Oxalis but Oxalis provides pick up and drop off from the town in any way, so was not an issue at all.\n\nOverall for the price (one of the lowest) we stayed in much better hotel than we expected, as we had just a night there. Could easily stay a week without thinking twice!",

The pool was great for resting (from all the hotels with pools im Vietnam, is the only one we actually tried, as the atmosphere around it was welcoming).\n\nThe host helped with a lot of information, an did our stay even better.\n\nThe Location was also close to the best restaurants in town and close to the bus station. Not so close to Oxalis but Oxalis provides pick up and drop off from the town in any way, so was not an issue at all.\n\nOverall for the price (one of the lowest) we stayed in much better hotel than we expected, as we had just a night there. Could easily stay a week without thinking twice!",

The pool was great for resting (from all the hotels with pools im Vietnam, is the only one we actually tried, as the atmosphere around it was welcoming).\n\nThe host helped with a lot of information, an did our stay even better.\n\nThe Location was also close to the best restaurants in town and close to the bus station. Not so close to Oxalis but Oxalis provides pick up and drop off from the town in any way, so was not an issue at all.\n\nOverall for the price (one of the lowest) we stayed in much better hotel than we expected, as we had just a night there. Could easily stay a week without thinking twice!",
