Na and her staff were wonderful ! Na went above and beyond to make sure our trip went smoothly…we cannot thank her enough for her patience and understanding! Another plus…our bed was so comfortable, and the bedding was amazing! The outdoor shower was wonderful…I loved taking a shower under the moonlight🙂",

Na and her staff were wonderful ! Na went above and beyond to make sure our trip went smoothly…we cannot thank her enough for her patience and understanding!

Na and her staff were wonderful ! Na went above and beyond to make sure our trip went smoothly…we cannot thank her enough for her patience and understanding!

For 80k I got a badly cooked, very moist omelette with 2 small slices of dry Baguette and a small glass of juice  Location far from centre, means you need to spend extra on transport into town (use Grab, much cheaper than what the hotel offers)."
