It's close to the city centre, market area and some pagodas. There are stores and restaurants nearby plus they have a cafe on the first floor of the hotel which is very convenient and the coffee they sell there is quite good (famous Vietnamese brand) and the staff is super nice.\nThe hotel staff is very nice and welcoming as well! They speak good English and the receptionist that i communicated with was  very helpful - he helped to find a bus to Can Tho and also organised a taxi for me to get to one of the temples. The taxi driver was the best, btw, and spoke English very well! :)",

The bed was lovely and comfortable, and the rooftop bar was a nice touch as a place for an evening drink. We didn't find the park below noisy at night (most of the noise died down before 'bed time') and it actually made for a nice place to visit in the evening, as it came alive with families enjoying the space at night. Located on a lovely street close to lots of restaurants and cafes",

I also don't recall seeing anywhere to buy/refill water onsite. There is no lift, so if you struggle with stairs I would recommend asking for a room on a lower floor, but otherwise we didn't find this an issue. Overall, the hotel was a nice place to stay, and these things wouldn't have mattered at all if it was slightly less expensive"

WiFi worked well and there were no strange smells or anything (I saw in other reviews that people mentioned that). \nThe location is pretty good. It's close to the city centre, market area and some pagodas. There are stores and restaurants nearby plus they have a cafe on the first floor of the hotel which is very convenient and the coffee they sell there is quite good (famous Vietnamese brand) and the staff is super nice.\nThe hotel staff is very nice and welcoming as well! They speak good English and the receptionist that i communicated with was  very helpful - he helped to find a bus to Can Tho and also organised a taxi for me to get to one of the temples. The taxi driver was the best, btw, and spoke English very well! :)",

The bed was lovely and comfortable, and the rooftop bar was a nice touch as a place for an evening drink. We didn't find the park below noisy at night (most of the noise died down before 'bed time') and it actually made for a nice place to visit in the evening, as it came alive with families enjoying the space at night. Located on a lovely street close to lots of restaurants and cafes",

I also don't recall seeing anywhere to buy/refill water onsite. There is no lift, so if you struggle with stairs I would recommend asking for a room on a lower floor, but otherwise we didn't find this an issue. Overall, the hotel was a nice place to stay, and these things wouldn't have mattered at all if it was slightly less expensive"

WiFi worked well and there were no strange smells or anything (I saw in other reviews that people mentioned that). \nThe location is pretty good. It's close to the city centre, market area and some pagodas. There are stores and restaurants nearby plus they have a cafe on the first floor of the hotel which is very convenient and the coffee they sell there is quite good (famous Vietnamese brand) and the staff is super nice.\nThe hotel staff is very nice and welcoming as well! They speak good English and the receptionist that i communicated with was  very helpful - he helped to find a bus to Can Tho and also organised a taxi for me to get to one of the temples. The taxi driver was the best, btw, and spoke English very well! :)",

The bed was lovely and comfortable, and the rooftop bar was a nice touch as a place for an evening drink. We didn't find the park below noisy at night (most of the noise died down before 'bed time') and it actually made for a nice place to visit in the evening, as it came alive with families enjoying the space at night. Located on a lovely street close to lots of restaurants and cafes",

I also don't recall seeing anywhere to buy/refill water onsite. There is no lift, so if you struggle with stairs I would recommend asking for a room on a lower floor, but otherwise we didn't find this an issue. Overall, the hotel was a nice place to stay, and these things wouldn't have mattered at all if it was slightly less expensive"
